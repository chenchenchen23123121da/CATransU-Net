CATransU-Net: Cross-Attention TransU-Net for Field Rice Pest Detection
# Introduction
In the world, rice, as an important food crop, plays an irreplaceable role in maintaining food security. Rice planting area and total output rank first in the world. Rice is the main crop in China, having a stable planting area of 30 million square hectometers, and an annual output of more than 2 trillion tons (Yuan et al.,2021). However, in the process of rice planting, all kinds of pests are happening to seriously threaten the yield and quality of rice, such as Brown Plant Hopper, Green Plant Hopper, Stem Borer, Gallmidge, Army worm, Rice leaf roler, Rice Gundhi Bug, Mole Cricket and Rice Hispa, as shown in Fig.1 (Fahad et al., 2020). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that rice pests cause annual losses of 20% up to 40% percent of global rice production (Conde et al., 2025). The development of efficient and accurate pest detection methods and technologies in paddy fields is of great significance for taking timely control measures and reducing pest losses (Popescu et al., 2023). Traditional rice pest monitoring relies on farmer experience, which cannot meet the needs of large-scale and diversified pest monitoring in smart agriculture.
